// in high level programming languages the code we right, is called as source code
// then we compile it into machine code / binary,
// which is called as object code
// during programming we need to store data in memory and we use variables to store it, which are user defined variables
// data types in C++ are int, short, long float, double, char, bool, string, etc
// int takes 4 bytes of memory   ==> 32 bits
// short takes 2 bytes of memory ==> 16 bits
// long takes 8 bytes of memory  ==> 64 bits
// float takes 4 bytes of memory for real numbers
// double takes 8 bytes of memory
// char takes 1 byte of memory
// bool takes 1 byte of memory
// string takes 4 bytes of memory
// we can store -32,768 to 32,767 in short
// we can store âˆ’2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 in int
// we can store -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 in long
// float range -3.4e38 to 3.4e38
// double range -1.7e308 to 1.7e308
