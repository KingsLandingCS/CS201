    // üìå What is ptr2?
    // ptr2 is a pointer to an int, which means it stores the address of a memory location where an int lives.

    //     üß† What is *ptr2?
    // *ptr2 is the value stored at the memory location that ptr2 points to.
    // This is called dereferencing the pointer.
    ptr2 = ptr1;

    //     ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Loop Iteration Breakdown
    // Let‚Äôs go step-by-step through what happens inside the loop.

    // ‚úÖ First Iteration: i = 1
    // cout << "Enter Age of Student " << i << ": ";
    // cin >> *ptr2;
    // totalAges = totalAges + *ptr2;
    // ptr2++;
    // *ptr2 means: store the age at the memory address ptr2 is pointing to

    // Let‚Äôs say user inputs 18
    // So *ptr2 = 18

    // totalAges = 0 + 18 = 18

    // ptr2++ now moves to the next memory address, i.e., [1]

    // Calculates the average age by dividing the sum (totalAges) by the number of students.
    // Then, it prints the result to the screen.
    // üö® Note: Since both totalAges and numberOfStudent are int, this does integer division (e.g., 35 / 4 = 8).
    cout << "Average Age: " << totalAges / numberOfStudent;

    // Releases the dynamically allocated memory created by malloc.
    //  You must do this to prevent memory leaks in C/C++.
    //  If you forget this, the memory stays allocated until your program ends. In larger programs, this can eat up memory over time.
    free(ptr1);

    // After freeing the memory, we make ptr2 point to NULL (i.e., nowhere).
    // This is good practice to avoid dangling pointers (i.e., pointers pointing to deleted memory).
    ptr2 = NULL;

    return 0;
}

// ‚ö†Ô∏è 2. What is a Memory Leak?
// ‚ùó Definition:
// A memory leak happens when you allocate memory on the heap but never free it, and you also lose the pointer to it.
// üìå Why it's bad:
// Over time, memory leaks can use up all available RAM.
// Your program becomes slow or even crashes in large applications.

// ‚ö†Ô∏è 3. What is a Dangling Pointer?
// ‚ùó Definition:
// A dangling pointer is a pointer that still points to memory that has already been freed.
// üìå Why it's dangerous:
// Accessing it may cause your program to crash or corrupt data.
// It's like pointing to a house that has been demolished.
// Even though ptr still exists, the memory it pointed to no longer belongs to your program.
// ‚úÖ To fix: Always set the pointer to NULL after free.

// üß† Imagine Your Program is a Kitchen üç≥
// When you're cooking:

// You use a counter (temporary space) to prepare food.

// You also have a storage cabinet (long-term space) to store ingredients.

// In your program:

// The counter is like the stack ‚Äî fast, temporary memory.

// The cabinet is like the heap ‚Äî slower, flexible memory.

// üí° What is the Heap in Programming?
// The heap is a part of your computer's memory where your program can store things while it's running, but you decide how much and when to clean up.

// Why use the heap?
// When you don‚Äôt know the size of data at compile time.

// When you want to store large or flexible data.

// When you want the data to last even after a function ends.

// üì¶ Stack vs Heap (Simple Table)
// Feature	Stack	Heap
// Speed	Fast	Slower
// Lifetime	Automatic (cleans itself)	Manual (you must clean it up)
// Size	Fixed, small	Large, flexible
// Syntax	Regular variable	new / mallocüì¶ Stack vs Heap (Simple Table)
// Feature	Stack	Heap
// Speed	Fast	Slower
// Lifetime	Automatic (cleans itself)	Manual (you must clean it up)
// Size	Fixed, small	Large, flexible
// Syntax	Regular variable	new / malloc

// ‚ùì Why Not Just Use Normal Variables?
// Because normal variables:
// disappear when the function ends.
// can‚Äôt handle unknown sizes at runtime.
// The heap is useful when you want:
// memory to stay even after the function ends.
// to create arrays, lists, or objects with flexible sizes.



// ‚úÖ Heap and Stack are both inside RAM
// When you run a program, your operating system gives it some memory from RAM. This memory is divided into different regions:

// sql
// Copy
// Edit
// +-----------------------------+ <-- High memory address
// |     Stack (local vars)     |
// |----------------------------|
// |     Heap (dynamic memory)  |
// |----------------------------|
// |     Data Segment           |
// |----------------------------|
// |     Code Segment (program) |
// +-----------------------------+ <-- Low memory address
// üí° Summary:
// Stack: Automatically managed memory (local variables, function calls).

// Heap: Manually managed memory (using new, delete, or malloc, free).
