// 3rd structure in programming is loop, when we want to run a block of code multiple times

// Top testing loop (While loop), in while loop the condition gets checked first before execution of the block qoute (body)
// bottom testing loop, in do while loop the block qoute (body) will get executed atleast once before checking the condition
